                    <p>After two years of legislative activity, the 115th Senate may be most notably
                        remembered for
                        their sweeping overhaul of our tax system, or their failure to come to terms on a revised version of the
                        Affordable Care Act.
                        However, amidst all of the political banter, <strong>who really was most loyal to their party?</strong>

                  <p class="paragraph-content">Not much of a surprise that Rand Paul voted least with the Republican party over the
                    two-year period.
                    As an ardent member of the Freedom caucus, he has been proud of his record to buck party trends.
                  </p><br>
                  <p class="paragraph-content">For democrats, Joe Manchin of West Virginia has historically voted moderately. Being in
                    a state that has shifted
                    red over the last few decades, he's been concious of his electorate.
                  </p><br>
                  <p class="paragraph-content">It's quite interesting to see that of the 51 Republicans in the Senate,
                    all but three -- Rand Paul (KY), Mike Lee (UT), and Susan Collins (ME) -- voted with the party at least
                    90 percent of the time. In an era of strong partisanship among the two parties, this is an indication that
                    Senate Majority Leader, Mitch McConnell, and his party's agenda were kept close in hand.
